### GUI System

1. UI Components
2. -> UI Nodes - abstract description of the UI
3. -> UI Renderers - displays UI into the game (different impl for server & for client)

### Notes

- Uses HUD for graphics and text because the HUD API offers a more flexible layout system than Formspecs
- Uses Formspecs only for interactable controls.
